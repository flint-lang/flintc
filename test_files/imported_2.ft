// Uncommenting this line throws the assertion in llvm!
// So the bug seems to be when using an entity type in a different file from the one it came from...
// We will see what the problem *really* is all about...
// TODO: It is still unclear why this function crashes the compiler, it seems to have something to
// do with the fact that it's a circular dependency, but why do entity types with circles represent
// a problem at all? This needs further investigations, i will open up an issue on GH for this. For
// now i will not fix it because i simply was unable to locate where it possibly could even come
// from. I did not find *any* clues on where this problem comes from and how to possibly fix it.
