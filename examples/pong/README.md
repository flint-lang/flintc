# pong

There exists a newer version of Pong which utilizes `raylib`, the `pong-2.0` example.

The pong example is a simple implementation of the game Pong. At the moment, Flint has no interoperability with C, so this means no libraries like SDL or raylib can be used for user input. Because of this reason, it is currently impossible to create any interactive applications, where things need to move or be rendered at the same time as the user inputs things.
